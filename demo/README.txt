DEMOS FOR KARAMBOLA


hard_spheres

Demonstrates the application of Minkowski Analysis to an ensemble of hard
spheres undergoing a phase transition.  The Voronoi diagram for each realization
is computed via qhull (http://qhull.org), and Minkowski Tensors are calculated
for each individual Voronoi cell.  The final plot shows the average anisotropy 
of the Voronoi cells as a function of packing fraction.

Run "run_all.sh", the final plot is found in the folder output_minkowski.
(The demo may take a few minutes to compute.)
